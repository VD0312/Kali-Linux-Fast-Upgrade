Here is what the default /etc/apt/source.list you should have

deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free
# For source package access, uncomment the following line
# deb-src http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free


After looking at prefered mirror from the link above, replace it on /etc/apt/sources.list such this:

deb http://kali.cs.nctu.edu.tw/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free
# For source package access, uncomment the following line
# deb-src http://kali.cs.nctu.edu.tw/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free


## Open and change it into EITHER OpenDNS or Google DNS
## Remove other DNS and DNS generated by NetworkManager
$ leafpad /etc/resolv.conf

## OpenDNS ##
nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220

## Google DNS ##
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4


Save and close the file.
Before you start updating, clear all apt caches.

[root@kali]# | apt clean


And finally keep your Kali Linux up to date:

[root@kali]# | apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt dist-upgrade -y
